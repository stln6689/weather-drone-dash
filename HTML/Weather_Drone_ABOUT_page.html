            <!-- white -->
            <p> For our EECS 159B Senior Design project, we decided to create a drone that gathers weather data to display on a real-time website, and also make weather predictions (forecasts) based off of previous data models from government websites with our own algorithms. </p>
        <h4> Objectives </h4> <!-- white -->
            <!-- white -->
             <ul>
                <li> Create a drone </li>
                <li> Have it detect certain weather parameters </li> 
                <li> Display weather conditions on an app/website in real time </li>
                <li> Create and design the app/website </li>
             </ul>
        <h4> Formal Summary </h4> <!-- white -->
            <!-- white -->
            <p> A drone will be built with the purpose of measuring multiple weather conditions and updating said conditions real time on a website. The 3 main obstacles within this project will be getting the drone to fly to a high enough altitude to be able to properly measure the weather conditions we want while also maintaining effective (real time) communication with the drone controller and the app, fitting the various types of sensors into our budget, and developing a real time software website that organizes the data measured. The weather condition parameters will be precipitation/humidity, temperature, wind, UV index, and air pollution index. </p>
        <h4> Use Cases, Customers, Practicality & Application to the Real World </h4> <!-- black -->
            <!-- white -->
            <p> This project’s use case is to detect weather conditions and update the display app/website in real time. The potential customers could be news or broadcasting channels, sport event companies, and finally emergency services. </p>

            <h4> Fall Quarter </h4> <!-- white -->
            <p> Weeks 1-2 (September 30th - October 11th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> As a team, we finalized that we would be building a Weather Drone Forecaster. </li>
                    <li> We created flowcharts with text and visual representation to present our idea to our advisor, Professor Peter Burke. </li>
                    <li> We started the process of researching compatible weather measurement components for the Raspberry Pi that we would be using. </li>
                    <li> We brainstormed the basic concept of the data transmission system. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 3 (October 12th - October 18th) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> We began to finalize the design where the Raspberry Pi would directly connect and transit data to the laptop instead of the drone itself. </li>
                    <li> We started to begin researching which website would work best to display our data. At this point, we had not found a website that would display our data so there were no major developments. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 4 (October 19th - October 25th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> We started to break down the code for both of our sockets, the Raspberry Pi and the laptop. </li>
                    <li> The battery and receiver were attached to the flight controller. The motors were also attached onto the legs of the drone chastity. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 5 (October 26th - November 1st) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> The python code for the host and server was created, and the server code was able to be executed, which meant the socket could be created. The host client at this time was unable to be connected to, likely due to naming or internet connection issues. </li>
                    <li> The flight controller was attached onto the drone itself. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 6 (November 2nd - November 8th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> The server and client were able to connect to each other as long as both were connected onto the same website network. Control Flow began to be documented in more detail so that the coding process could be easier. </li>
                    <li> The GPS was installed onto the drone, as well as other positioning aids. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Weeks 7-8 (November 9th - November 22nd) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The flight controller on the drone was flashed and GPS was calibrated at this point after some slight issues. The physical parts of the drone were fully completed at this point, which included securing the top frame and velcroing the battery into place. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Weeks 9-10 (November 23rd - December 6th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> The final build of the drone was completed in accordance with the EECS 195 class. </li>
                    <li> The Fall Quarter Final Report was created and finalized. </li>
                </ul>
            
            <h4> Winter Quarter </h4> <!-- white -->
            <p> Weeks 1-2 (January 6th -  January 17th) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The server and client code was separated into various segments, making the flow of the code more organized. Testing with the Raspberry Pi had not yet been completed. </li>
                    <li> Telemetry components were purchased; the team was waiting for them to come in to begin implementation. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 3 (January 18th - January 24th) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Test code was created for the BME280 sensor. The data for temperature, pressure, and humidity was able to be extracted. However, there was a coding bug with the BME280 that needed to be fixed. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 4 (January 25th - January 31st) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> No new progress was made on the code, as the Raspberry Pi could not connect to its server. </li>
                    <li> The Figma Wireframing Draft of our website prototype was created. We began to experiment with the idea of implementing a predictive algorithm for the weather forecast. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 5 (February 1st - February 7th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> The Raspberry Pi server was fixed after a random reboot. The server was able to begin reading logic to interpret the weather data. Once this was completed, it was able to send it directly to the client’s display. </li>
                    <li> Initial Beta website was created following majority of the skeleton from the Figma Wireframing prototype. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Weeks 6-7 (February 8th - February 21st) </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Progress was finally made on connecting the UV index telemetry module to the Raspberry Pi. The team realized the module they purchased gave back an analog value, whereas the Raspberry Pi only reads digital values. However after trying a converter module, initial testing the UV index value only came back as the constant 255, or the max value. </li>
                    <li> All of the outline from the Figma prototype has been completed for the website (HTML, CSS) </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 8 (February 22nd - February 28th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> After numerous testings, it was found that the ADP code was outdated for Raspberry Pi 5 instead of Raspberry Pi Zero. </li>
                    <li> Initial Beta website displays temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and UV values, however the JavaScript for live updates and calculating average collected values from data.txt file is still being developed. </li>
                </ul>
            <p> Week 9 (March 1st - March 9th) </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Radio controller having issues connecting with controller. </li>
                    <li> Raspberry Pi Zero and final components have been soldered onto the drone. </li>
                    <li> JavaScript for live updates and calculating average collected values from data.txt file is completed. Final website and formatting has also been finalized and completed. </li>
                </ul>
